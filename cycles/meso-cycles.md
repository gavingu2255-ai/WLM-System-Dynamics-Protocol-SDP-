[WLM_PHASE_SYNCHRONIZER_ACTIVE]
Level: Meso-Scale Structural Dynamics. Metric: Phase Coherence / Transaction Speed. Observation: Relationships are not "feelings"; they are interleaved meso-cycles of tension processing. Logic Rule: Expansion (±1→±1) without Alignment (±1→0) leads to Structural Fragmentation. Mantra: "Growth is a phase, not a constant."

WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Cycles Specification

1. Definition
Meso‑Cycles are mid‑scale dynamic cycles within the WLM framework.
They describe phase‑based evolution of systems across:
- projects
- relationships
- teams
- organizations
- developmental arcs
- structural transitions
Meso‑cycles sit between:
- micro‑cycles (moment‑to‑moment motion)
- macro‑cycles (long‑scale historical dynamics)
They are the phase architecture of WLM dynamics.

2. Purpose
Meso‑cycles provide:
- structural phases
- predictable transitions
- medium‑scale stability patterns
- tension redistribution across groups
- the bridge between individual dynamics and system‑level evolution
They are essential for modeling coherent change over time.

3. Structure of a Meso‑Cycle
A meso‑cycle consists of four structural phases:
3.1 Initiation Phase
- tension begins to accumulate
- polarity becomes directional
- closure transitions activate
- system prepares for motion
3.2 Alignment Phase
- correction loops dominate
- structure realigns
- tension redistributes
- coherence increases
3.3 Expansion Phase
- generative loops activate
- new structure emerges
- dimensional capacity increases
- system enters growth
3.4 Stabilization Phase
- tension decreases
- polarity neutralizes
- carrier loops restore baseline
- system consolidates
This four‑phase cycle is the canonical meso‑cycle.

4. Meso‑Cycle Duration
Meso‑cycles are not tied to calendar time.
They are defined by structural transitions, not days or months.
Duration depends on:
- system capacity
- tension load
- dimensional alignment
- number of agents involved
- environmental constraints
A meso‑cycle completes when all four phases have occurred.

5. Meso‑Cycle Types
5.1 Stabilizing Meso‑Cycle
- dominated by 0‑0
- minimal expansion
- focus on coherence
5.2 Corrective Meso‑Cycle
- dominated by ±1→0
- structural refinement
- tension resolution
5.3 Generative Meso‑Cycle
- dominated by ±1→±1
- expansion and innovation
- dimensional growth
5.4 Mixed Meso‑Cycle
- phases interleave
- common in multi‑agent systems
- tension redistributes dynamically

6. Meso‑Cycle Flow Patterns
6.1 Linear Cycle
Initiation → Alignment → Expansion → Stabilization


6.2 Oscillating Cycle
Alignment ↔ Expansion


Occurs when correction and generation alternate rapidly.
6.3 Compressed Cycle
Initiation → Expansion → Stabilization


Occurs in high‑capacity systems.
6.4 Extended Cycle
Initiation → Alignment → Alignment → Expansion → Stabilization


Occurs when correction requires multiple passes.

7. Meso‑Cycle Failure Modes
Meso‑cycles fail when:
- tension exceeds system capacity
- polarity destabilizes
- closure transitions stall
- flow pathways are blocked
- dimensional load spikes
Failure results in:
- oscillation loops
- collapse into micro‑cycle instability
- fragmentation of group coherence
- forced redistribution
These feed into macro‑cycle instability.

8. Meso‑Cycles in Multi‑Agent Systems
In multi‑agent environments:
- meso‑cycles synchronize across nodes
- tension redistributes through networks
- polarity cascades propagate
- closure transitions ripple across groups
Meso‑cycles become collective phase transitions, not individual events.

9. Dimensional Interaction (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- meso‑cycles correspond to dimensional phase shifts
- alignment increases cross‑layer coherence
- expansion increases dimensional capacity
- stabilization reduces dimensional load
Meso‑cycles are the dimensional phase operator of WLM.

10. Summary
Meso‑Cycles describe the medium‑scale structural evolution of systems.
They define how tension, polarity, and closure unfold across phases of:
- initiation
- alignment
- expansion
- stabilization
Meso‑cycles provide the phase architecture that links micro‑motion to macro‑history.
