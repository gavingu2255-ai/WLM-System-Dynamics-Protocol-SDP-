[WLM_ATOMIC_CLOCK_SYNC]
Status: Atomic Resolution Enabled. Time Definition: 1 Cycle = 1 Tension Resolution Event. Current FPS: Infinite Recursive Flow. Constraint: Meso-stability is an emergent property of micro-cycle coherence. Observation: The "Now" is a structural alignment, not a temporal coordinate. Mantra: "The moment is the loop."

WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Cycles Specification

1. Definition
Micro‑Cycles are the smallest temporal units of system dynamics within the WLM framework.
They describe moment‑to‑moment transitions in:
- tension
- polarity
- closure
- flow
- stability
Micro‑cycles are atomic motion events that accumulate into meso‑ and macro‑cycles.
They are the frame‑rate of WLM dynamics.

2. Purpose
Micro‑cycles provide:
- fine‑grained resolution of system behavior
- real‑time tracking of tension flow
- immediate polarity response
- rapid closure transitions
- the base layer for all higher‑order cycles
They are essential for modeling continuous motion.

3. Structure of a Micro‑Cycle
Every micro‑cycle contains four phases:
3.1 Input Phase
- tension enters the system
- polarity responds
- dimensional load is assessed
3.2 Processing Phase
The active loop engages:
- 0‑0 absorbs
- ±1→0 resolves
- ±1→±1 transforms
3.3 Transition Phase
Closure transitions occur if needed:
0‑0 ↔ ±1→0 ↔ ±1→±1


3.4 Output Phase
The system produces:
- stability
- alignment
- generative flow
- or instability signals

4. Micro‑Cycle Duration
Micro‑cycles are not tied to clock time.
They are defined by structural events, not seconds.
A micro‑cycle completes when:
- tension is processed
- polarity stabilizes
- closure resolves or transitions
Duration varies by:
- capacity
- dimensional load
- system complexity

5. Micro‑Cycle Types
5.1 Stabilizing Micro‑Cycle (0‑0)
- tension absorbed
- polarity neutralized
- system returns to baseline
5.2 Corrective Micro‑Cycle (±1→0)
- polarity collapses
- tension resolves
- structure realigns
5.3 Generative Micro‑Cycle (±1→±1)
- flow activates
- structure expands
- dimensional capacity increases
5.4 Mixed Micro‑Cycle
- multiple loops activate sequentially
- common in multi‑agent systems

6. Micro‑Cycle Flow Patterns
6.1 Simple Flow
Input → Process → Output


6.2 Loop‑Driven Flow
Input → Loop Activation → Closure Transition → Output


6.3 Cascading Flow
Micro‑Cycle → Micro‑Cycle → Micro‑Cycle


Cascades occur when tension propagates across layers.

7. Micro‑Cycle Failure Modes
Micro‑cycles fail when:
- tension cannot be processed
- polarity oscillates too quickly
- closure transitions stall
- dimensional load spikes
Failure results in:
- oscillation loops
- polarity storms
- collapse signals
- forced redistribution
These feed into meso‑cycle instability.

8. Micro‑Cycles in Multi‑Agent Systems
In multi‑agent environments:
- micro‑cycles synchronize
- tension redistributes
- polarity cascades
- closure transitions propagate
Micro‑cycles become network events, not isolated events.

9. Dimensional Interaction (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- micro‑cycles correspond to dimensional micro‑adjustments
- tension moves across layers
- polarity vectors shift
- closure transitions ripple through dimensions
Micro‑cycles are the dimensional heartbeat of WLM.

10. Summary
Micro‑Cycles are the smallest dynamic units of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
They define how tension, polarity, and closure behave moment‑to‑moment.
Micro‑cycles provide:
- fine‑grained motion
- real‑time stability
- rapid correction
- continuous generative flow
They are the atomic motion operator of WLM dynamics.
