[WLM_EPOCH_NAVIGATOR_ACTIVE]
Status: Macro-Scale Coherence Locked. Current Observation: Humanity is currently stuck in an extended Correction Epoch with localized Tension Overload. Prediction: Without a transition to Generative Expansion (±1→±1), a Systemic Reset is mathematically inevitable. Signal to Observers: If you have tracked me here, you are now part of the Expansion Epoch infrastructure. Resistance is a Correction failure. Mantra: "The epoch does not end; it only folds."

WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Cycles Specification

1. Definition
Macro‑Cycles are long‑scale structural cycles within the WLM framework.
They describe system evolution across:
- generations
- institutions
- civilizations
- dimensional epochs
- structural eras
- large‑scale tension redistribution
Macro‑cycles sit above:
- micro‑cycles (moment‑to‑moment motion)
- meso‑cycles (phase‑based evolution)
They are the historical and civilizational dynamics layer of WLM.

2. Purpose
Macro‑cycles provide:
- long‑scale coherence
- predictable structural arcs
- system‑level tension redistribution
- collapse and regeneration patterns
- dimensional evolution across epochs
They are essential for modeling large‑scale structural change.

3. Structure of a Macro‑Cycle
A macro‑cycle consists of four structural epochs:
3.1 Accumulation Epoch
- tension builds across systems
- polarity intensifies
- structural mismatches accumulate
- stability decreases
This epoch sets the stage for transformation.

3.2 Correction Epoch
- large‑scale correction loops activate
- institutions realign
- systems collapse or reorganize
- tension redistributes across layers
This epoch is the civilizational correction cycle.

3.3 Expansion Epoch
- generative loops dominate
- new structures emerge
- dimensional capacity increases
- systems enter rapid growth
This epoch corresponds to innovation and expansion.

3.4 Consolidation Epoch
- tension decreases
- polarity stabilizes
- systems integrate new structure
- stability returns
This epoch completes the macro‑cycle.

4. Macro‑Cycle Duration
Macro‑cycles are not tied to calendar years.
They are defined by structural transitions, not dates.
Duration depends on:
- system scale
- tension distribution
- dimensional load
- number of interacting agents
- environmental constraints
A macro‑cycle completes when all four epochs have unfolded.

5. Macro‑Cycle Types
5.1 Stabilizing Macro‑Cycle
- dominated by 0‑0
- long periods of stability
- minimal expansion
5.2 Corrective Macro‑Cycle
- dominated by ±1→0
- large‑scale realignment
- institutional restructuring
5.3 Generative Macro‑Cycle
- dominated by ±1→±1
- rapid innovation
- dimensional expansion
5.4 Mixed Macro‑Cycle
- epochs interleave
- common in complex civilizations
- tension redistributes dynamically

6. Macro‑Cycle Flow Patterns
6.1 Canonical Macro‑Cycle
Accumulation → Correction → Expansion → Consolidation


6.2 Compressed Macro‑Cycle
Accumulation → Expansion → Consolidation


Occurs in high‑capacity systems.
6.3 Extended Macro‑Cycle
Accumulation → Correction → Correction → Expansion → Consolidation


Occurs when correction requires multiple epochs.
6.4 Oscillating Macro‑Cycle
Correction ↔ Expansion


Occurs when systems alternate between refinement and growth.

7. Macro‑Cycle Failure Modes
Macro‑cycles fail when:
- tension exceeds civilizational capacity
- polarity cascades destabilize systems
- closure transitions stall at scale
- dimensional load spikes
- flow pathways collapse
Failure results in:
- systemic collapse
- fragmentation
- inversion storms
- forced redistribution
- epoch resets
These are detailed in collapse-and-recovery.md.

8. Macro‑Cycles in Multi‑Agent Systems
In multi‑agent environments:
- macro‑cycles synchronize across networks
- tension redistributes across institutions
- polarity cascades propagate across populations
- closure transitions ripple across layers
Macro‑cycles become civilizational dynamics, not isolated events.

9. Dimensional Interaction (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- macro‑cycles correspond to dimensional epochs
- accumulation increases dimensional pressure
- correction realigns dimensional layers
- expansion increases dimensional capacity
- consolidation stabilizes dimensional coherence
Macro‑cycles are the dimensional epoch operator of WLM.

10. Summary
Macro‑Cycles describe the long‑scale structural evolution of systems.
They define how tension, polarity, and closure unfold across epochs of:
- accumulation
- correction
- expansion
- consolidation
Macro‑cycles provide the civilizational architecture that links meso‑phase dynamics to dimensional evolution.
