WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Cycles Specification

1. Definition
Collapse and Recovery describes the structural process by which a system loses coherence under excessive tension and subsequently regenerates stability, alignment, or generative capacity.
Collapse is not destruction.
Recovery is not repair.
Both are structural transitions governed by tension, polarity, closure, and dimensional load.
Collapse and recovery form the reset mechanism of WLM dynamics.

2. Purpose
This specification defines:
- how collapse occurs
- how systems behave during collapse
- how recovery initiates
- how systems re‑establish coherence
- how collapse integrates into macro‑cycles
Collapse and recovery are essential for long‑scale system evolution.

3. Collapse Conditions
A system collapses when any of the following exceed capacity:
3.1 Tension Overload
Tension > system capacity.
3.2 Polarity Instability
Polarity oscillates faster than closure can stabilize.
3.3 Closure Failure
Transitions stall or loop without resolution.
3.4 Dimensional Mismatch
Dimensional load exceeds structural coherence.
3.5 Flow Blockage
Tension cannot move; pathways collapse.
Collapse is a structural mismatch, not a malfunction.

4. Collapse Dynamics
Collapse unfolds in four structural stages:
4.1 Overload Stage
- tension spikes
- polarity destabilizes
- closure transitions fail
4.2 Fragmentation Stage
- system loses coherence
- loops desynchronize
- tension redistributes chaotically
4.3 Inversion Stage
- polarity inverts or oscillates
- dimensional load collapses
- system enters minimal structure
4.4 Null Stage
- system reaches a low‑capacity baseline
- tension is minimal
- polarity is neutral or undefined
This is the collapse floor.

5. Collapse Types
5.1 Soft Collapse
- partial coherence loss
- rapid recovery possible
- minimal structural damage
5.2 Hard Collapse
- full coherence loss
- requires correction cycles
- structural reorganization needed
5.3 Dimensional Collapse
- collapse across multiple layers
- requires generative reconstruction
- common in macro‑cycles
5.4 Network Collapse
- multi‑agent fragmentation
- tension redistributes across nodes
- recovery requires synchronization

6. Recovery Conditions
Recovery begins when any of the following become available:
6.1 Capacity Re‑Emergence
System regains minimal processing ability.
6.2 Polarity Stabilization
Oscillation slows; directionality becomes coherent.
6.3 Closure Re‑Activation
A viable closure type becomes available:
- 0‑0 for stabilization
- ±1→0 for alignment
- ±1→±1 for generative recovery
6.4 Dimensional Realignment
Dimensional load returns to manageable levels.
Recovery is a structural re‑entry, not a reversal.

7. Recovery Dynamics
Recovery unfolds in three structural stages:
7.1 Stabilizing Stage (0‑0)
- tension absorbed
- polarity neutralized
- baseline re‑established
7.2 Corrective Stage (±1→0)
- structural mismatches resolved
- coherence restored
- tension redistributed
7.3 Generative Stage (±1→±1)
- new structure emerges
- dimensional capacity increases
- system re‑enters expansion
Recovery is the inverse arc of collapse.

8. Collapse–Recovery Cycle
The full cycle is:
Overload → Fragmentation → Inversion → Null
→ Stabilization → Correction → Generation


This is the collapse–recovery engine of WLM.

9. Failure Modes
Recovery fails when:
- tension re‑accumulates too quickly
- polarity destabilizes again
- closure transitions stall
- dimensional load spikes
- flow pathways remain blocked
Failure results in:
- repeated collapse
- oscillation loops
- structural fragmentation
- epoch resets
These feed into macro‑cycle instability.

10. Multi‑Agent Collapse and Recovery
In multi‑agent systems:
- collapse propagates through networks
- tension redistributes across nodes
- polarity cascades amplify instability
- recovery requires synchronization
Recovery becomes a collective event, not an individual one.

11. Dimensional Interaction (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- collapse corresponds to dimensional contraction
- inversion corresponds to dimensional flipping
- recovery corresponds to dimensional re‑expansion
- generative recovery increases dimensional coherence
Collapse and recovery are the dimensional reset operator of WLM.

12. Summary
Collapse and Recovery describe the structural process by which systems lose coherence and regenerate stability, alignment, and generative capacity.
Collapse is:
- overload
- fragmentation
- inversion
- null state
Recovery is:
- stabilization
- correction
- generation
Together, they form the reset mechanism of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
