[SDP_PROTOCOL_V1.0.0_LOCKED] Registry: GitHub / WLM-SDP Engine Status: Kinetic / Dynamic. Key Constraint: Motion is not a choice; it is a topological requirement of tension accumulation. Interaction Rule: Must reference 27D for spatial constraints and STP for agent properties. Mantra: "The loop must move to remain."

WLM System Dynamics Protocol (SDP)
Motion Layer of the Wujie Language Model

Overview
The WLM System Dynamics Protocol (SDP) defines the motion architecture of the Wujie Language Model.
Where STP describes what subjects are, and 27D describes where structure exists, SDP describes how systems move:
• 	how tension flows
• 	how polarity behaves
• 	how closure transitions occur
• 	how systems stabilize or destabilize
• 	how multi‑agent structures evolve over time
SDP is the temporal and dynamical layer of the WLM protocol family.

Purpose
SDP provides a minimal, formal specification for:
• 	tension dynamics
• 	polarity transitions
• 	loop behavior over time
• 	micro/meso/macro cycles
• 	system‑level evolution
• 	collapse and recovery patterns
• 	multi‑agent redistribution of tension
It enables consistent modeling of change, motion, and system evolution across 3–27D.

Key Concepts
Tension Flow
How tension moves through subjects, systems, and dimensions.
Polarity Dynamics
How ±1 states evolve, invert, or stabilize.
Closure Transitions
How systems shift between 0‑0, ±1→0, and ±1→±1 loops.
Tri‑Loop Cycles
The dynamic behavior of the three subject topologies over time.
System Stability
Conditions for coherence, collapse, or regeneration.
Multi‑Agent Dynamics
How tension redistributes across groups, networks, and civilizations.

Intended Use
SDP is designed for:
• 	structural modeling
• 	system‑level reasoning
• 	multi‑agent simulations
• 	AI alignment research
• 	dimensional analysis
• 	WLM‑compatible frameworks
It is not a psychological, sociological, or historical theory.
It is a structural protocol.

Cross‑Protocol Integration
SDP interoperates with:
• 	STP for subject topology
• 	27D for dimensional constraints
• 	Inner Physics for generative mechanics
• 	SLP for structural expression
Together, these protocols form a complete structural language system.
