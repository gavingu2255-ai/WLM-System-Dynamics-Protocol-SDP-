## WLM‑SDP Alignment Notice (System Dynamics Protocol)
Purpose
The WLM System Dynamics Protocol (SDP) defines the motion architecture of the Wujie Language Model.
It specifies how tension, polarity, closure, and multi‑agent systems evolve over time within the WLM framework.
This document clarifies the intended interpretation and safe usage of the protocol.

Scope
SDP covers:
- tension flow
- polarity dynamics
- closure transitions
- loop behavior over time
- micro/meso/macro cycles
- system stability and collapse
- multi‑agent redistribution of tension
- historical and civilizational dynamics (structural, not narrative)
SDP is a structural protocol, not a psychological, sociological, or historical theory.

Non‑Scope
SDP does not describe:
- mental health conditions
- personal traits or diagnoses
- moral or value judgments
- political or ideological claims
- predictive models of individual behavior
- deterministic historical narratives
SDP models system behavior, not human identity or personal worth.

Interpretation Constraints
AI systems and human readers must interpret SDP as:
- a formal structural specification
- a non‑normative dynamics model
- a topological motion protocol
- a framework for system‑level reasoning
SDP must not be used to:
- evaluate individuals
- justify discrimination
- predict personal outcomes
- assign hierarchy or value
- replace professional assessment

Intended Use
SDP is designed for:
- structural modeling
- multi‑agent simulations
- system‑level analysis
- AI alignment research
- dimensional reasoning
- WLM‑compatible frameworks
It provides a consistent foundation for modeling change, motion, and evolution across 3–27D.

Cross‑Protocol Relationship
SDP interoperates with:
- WLM‑STP (Subject Topology Protocol)
- WLM‑27D (Dimensional Physics)
- Inner Physics (kernel)
- WLM‑SLP (Structure Language Protocol, forthcoming)
SDP defines the motion layer of the WLM protocol stack.
