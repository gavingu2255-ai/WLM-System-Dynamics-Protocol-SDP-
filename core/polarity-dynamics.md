[POLARITY_VECTOR_OPERATOR_ACTIVE]
Current State: Directional logic locked.
Law of Vector: Polarity $\pm 1$ is a function of Tension Gradient $\nabla T$.
Safety Protocol: Inversion triggered at $T > Capacity_{local}$.
Interaction: STP provides the loop; SDP provides the spin.
Mantra: "Direction is a derivative of Tension."

WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Core Specification

1. Definition
Polarity Dynamics describes how ±1 states behave, evolve, invert, and stabilize within the WLM System Dynamics Protocol (SDP).
Where tension‑flow defines movement, polarity‑dynamics defines the directional structure of that movement.
Polarity is not emotional, moral, or psychological.
It is a structural operator that determines:
- direction of tension
- activation of loops
- closure transitions
- system evolution
- dimensional shifts

2. Polarity as a Structural Variable
Polarity has three possible states:
- +1 — outward, expansion, projection
- −1 — inward, contraction, absorption
- 0 — neutral, non‑directional, closure state
Polarity is not binary; it is a directional vector in structural space.

3. Polarity Behavior Rules
Rule 1 — Polarity expresses tension
Polarity becomes active only when tension is present.
Rule 2 — Polarity follows gradients
Polarity aligns with the direction of steepest tension gradient.
Rule 3 — Polarity is recursive
Polarity at one layer influences polarity at adjacent layers.
Rule 4 — Polarity is closure‑dependent
The active closure type determines how polarity behaves:
- 0‑0 dampens polarity
- ±1→0 resolves polarity
- ±1→±1 amplifies or transforms polarity
Rule 5 — Polarity is reversible
Polarity can invert under overload or collapse.

4. Polarity States
4.1 Stable Polarity
Occurs when:
- tension is low
- closure is consistent
- system is coherent
Stable polarity produces predictable dynamics.
4.2 Unstable Polarity
Occurs when:
- tension is high
- closure is inconsistent
- system is fragmented
Unstable polarity produces oscillation or inversion.
4.3 Collapsed Polarity
Occurs when:
- tension exceeds capacity
- flow is blocked
- system cannot express direction
Collapsed polarity leads to forced redistribution.

5. Polarity Inversion
Polarity inversion is a structural event where:
+1 → −1
or
−1 → +1


Inversion occurs when:
- tension exceeds local capacity
- closure fails
- flow is blocked
- dimensional load is too high
Inversion is not an error; it is a safety mechanism that prevents collapse.

6. Polarity and Closure Types
6.1 0‑0 (Carrier Loop)
- polarity is absorbed
- directionality is neutralized
- tension is dampened
6.2 ±1→0 (Correction Loop)
- polarity is resolved
- directionality collapses to zero
- tension returns to baseline
6.3 ±1→±1 (Flow Loop)
- polarity is maintained
- directionality becomes flow
- tension becomes generative energy
Polarity behavior is inseparable from closure behavior.

7. Polarity Cascades
A polarity cascade occurs when polarity propagates across:
- layers
- subjects
- systems
- dimensions
Cascades are triggered by:
- overload
- collapse
- rapid expansion
- structural mismatch
Cascades can be stabilizing or destabilizing depending on closure type.

8. Polarity in 27D
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- polarity is a vector in dimensional space
- higher dimensions allow multi‑directional polarity
- dimensional folds can invert or redirect polarity
- polarity determines flow pathways
Polarity is the directional operator of 27D dynamics.

9. Polarity Failure Modes
Failure occurs when polarity cannot stabilize or resolve.
Failure modes include:
- oscillation loops
- runaway polarity
- inversion storms
- directional collapse
- fragmentation
These are defined in detail in system-stability.md.

10. Summary
Polarity Dynamics defines how ±1 states behave within the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
It governs directionality, closure transitions, system evolution, and dimensional behavior.
Polarity is the directional operator of the WLM motion architecture.
