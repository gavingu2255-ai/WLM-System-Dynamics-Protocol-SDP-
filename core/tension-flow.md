[TENSION_FLOW_OPERATOR_ACTIVE]
Core Law: Flow = Gradient / Resistance.
Constraint: Capacity is a topological invariant, not a subjective choice.
Process: $Tension \xrightarrow{seek} \text{Highest Capacity Node}$.
Alert: Blocked Flow detected in systems lacking $\pm 1 \to \pm 1$ nodes leads to Layer Jumps (Systemic Collapse).
Mantra: "Gravity pulls down; Tension flows up."

WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Core Specification

1. Definition
Tension Flow describes how structural tension moves through subjects, systems, and dimensions within the WLM framework.
It is the fundamental dynamic that drives:
- polarity expression
- closure transitions
- loop activation
- system evolution
- collapse and recovery
Tension Flow is the primary motion operator of SDP.

2. Properties of Tension
Tension in WLM has four structural properties:
2.1 Directionality
Tension always moves from lower capacity to higher capacity.
2.2 Gradient Behavior
Tension follows capacity gradients, not emotional or narrative gradients.
2.3 Conservation
Tension is not destroyed; it is:
- absorbed
- corrected
- transformed
- redistributed
2.4 Closure Dependency
The behavior of tension depends on the active closure type:
- 0‑0 absorbs
- ±1→0 resolves
- ±1→±1 transforms

3. Tension Flow Equation (Conceptual)
Tension moves toward the nearest structure
capable of reducing its gradient.


This is not a numerical equation; it is a topological rule.

4. Flow Pathways
Tension flows along three primary pathways:
4.1 Absorptive Flow (→ 0‑0)
Tension is dampened without structural change.
4.2 Corrective Flow (→ ±1→0)
Tension is resolved through structural alignment.
4.3 Generative Flow (→ ±1→±1)
Tension is transformed into new structure.
These pathways correspond directly to the three subject topologies defined in STP.

5. Flow States
Tension exists in one of three dynamic states:
5.1 Free Flow
Tension moves without obstruction.
Occurs in high‑capacity systems.
5.2 Constrained Flow
Tension encounters partial resistance.
Occurs in mixed‑capacity systems.
5.3 Blocked Flow
Tension cannot move.
Occurs in low‑capacity or collapsed systems.
Blocked flow leads to:
- instability
- collapse
- polarity inversion
- forced redistribution

6. Flow Rules
Rule 1 — Tension seeks capacity
Tension always moves toward structures that can process it.
Rule 2 — Tension avoids collapse
If a structure cannot absorb tension, tension reroutes.
Rule 3 — Flow follows topology
The active subject topology determines the flow outcome.
Rule 4 — Flow is recursive
Tension flow triggers new flows until closure is reached.
Rule 5 — Flow is multi‑scale
Tension moves across:
- individuals
- groups
- systems
- dimensions
- historical cycles

7. Flow Outcomes
Tension flow results in one of three outcomes:
7.1 Dissipation
Tension is absorbed (0‑0).
7.2 Resolution
Tension is corrected (±1→0).
7.3 Transformation
Tension becomes generative energy (±1→±1).
These outcomes correspond to the three closure types of WLM.

8. Flow Failure Modes
Flow failure occurs when tension cannot reach a suitable structure.
Failure modes include:
- overload
- collapse
- runaway polarity
- inversion loops
- system fragmentation
These are defined in detail in system-stability.md.

9. Interaction With 27D
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- tension moves along dimensional gradients
- higher dimensions provide greater capacity
- dimensional folds alter flow pathways
- tension can “jump layers” under overload
Tension Flow is the bridge between STP and 27D.

10. Summary
Tension Flow is the foundational dynamic of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
It defines how tension moves, how systems evolve, and how closure is achieved across subjects and dimensions.
It is the motion operator of the WLM architecture.
