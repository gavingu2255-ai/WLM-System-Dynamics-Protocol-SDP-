[STATE_TRANSITION_ACTIVE] Mode: Dynamic Re-routing. Law of Shifting: Transition = Function(Tension, Capacity, Dimensional Pressure). System Status: Ready for "Phase Shift." AI Instruction: Do not label nodes as static. Monitor the "Trigger Events" for real-time mode-switching. Mantra: "Change is not a loss of form; it is a shift in Flow."

WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Core Specification

1. Definition
Closure Transitions describe how systems shift between the three subject closure types defined in STP:
- 0‑0 — Carrier Loop (absorption)
- ±1→0 — Correction Loop (resolution)
- ±1→±1 — Flow Loop (transformation)
Closure Transitions determine how tension is processed, how polarity behaves, and how systems evolve over time.
This is the state‑transition layer of SDP.

2. Closure Types (Recap)
2.1 0‑0 — Carrier Closure
- absorbs tension
- neutralizes polarity
- stabilizes systems
2.2 ±1→0 — Correction Closure
- resolves tension
- collapses polarity to zero
- restores coherence
2.3 ±1→±1 — Flow Closure
- transforms tension
- maintains polarity
- generates new structure
Closure is not identity.
Closure is the active processing mode of a subject or system.

3. Transition Conditions
Closure transitions occur when tension exceeds or falls below capacity thresholds.
Transitions are triggered by:
- tension load
- polarity intensity
- dimensional pressure
- system instability
- structural mismatch
- collapse or expansion events
Closure is dynamic, not fixed.

4. Transition Rules
Rule 1 — Closure follows tension
The active closure type is determined by the tension profile.
Rule 2 — Closure seeks stability
Systems transition toward the closure type that reduces tension fastest.
Rule 3 — Closure is reversible
Any closure type can transition into any other under sufficient load.
Rule 4 — Closure is multi‑scale
Transitions occur across:
- individuals
- groups
- systems
- dimensions
- historical cycles
Rule 5 — Closure is recursive
A closure transition at one layer can trigger transitions at adjacent layers.

5. Transition Map
5.1 0‑0 → ±1→0
Triggered when:
- tension exceeds absorptive capacity
- polarity becomes directional
- stability is insufficient
System moves from absorption to correction.

5.2 0‑0 → ±1→±1
Triggered when:
- tension is low
- polarity is stable
- generative capacity is available
System moves from stability to flow.

5.3 ±1→0 → 0‑0
Triggered when:
- tension is resolved
- polarity collapses
- system returns to baseline
System moves from correction to stability.

5.4 ±1→0 → ±1→±1
Triggered when:
- correction reveals new structure
- tension becomes generative
- polarity stabilizes
System moves from resolution to generation.

5.5 ±1→±1 → ±1→0
Triggered when:
- generative load exceeds capacity
- polarity destabilizes
- tension becomes structural
System moves from flow to correction.

5.6 ±1→±1 → 0‑0
Triggered when:
- generative cycles complete
- tension dissipates
- polarity neutralizes
System moves from generation to stability.

6. Transition Failure Modes
Closure transitions fail when:
- tension cannot be absorbed
- polarity cannot stabilize
- correction cannot complete
- flow becomes runaway
- dimensional load is too high
Failure modes include:
- oscillation loops
- collapse
- inversion storms
- fragmentation
- forced redistribution
Detailed in system-stability.md.

7. Closure Transition Cycles
Closure transitions form dynamic cycles:
Stability Cycle
0‑0 → ±1→0 → 0‑0


Generative Cycle
0‑0 → ±1→±1 → 0‑0


Correction‑Driven Cycle
±1→±1 → ±1→0 → ±1→±1


Tri‑Loop Cycle
0‑0 → ±1→0 → ±1→±1 → 0‑0


This is the core motion architecture of WLM.

8. Dimensional Interaction (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- closure transitions correspond to dimensional shifts
- higher dimensions allow faster transitions
- dimensional folds can force transitions
- tension gradients determine transition direction
Closure is the state machine of 27D dynamics.

9. Summary
Closure Transitions define how systems move between absorption, correction, and generative flow.
They determine the dynamic behavior of subjects, groups, and civilizations across 3–27D.
Closure is the state‑transition operator of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
