WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Core Specification

1. Definition
System Stability describes the conditions under which a subject, group, or multi‑agent system maintains coherent operation under tension, polarity, and dimensional load.
Stability is not emotional or psychological.
It is a structural property defined by:
- capacity
- closure integrity
- tension flow
- polarity behavior
- dimensional alignment
System Stability is the coherence operator of SDP.

2. Stability Components
A system is stable when the following components are aligned:
2.1 Capacity
The system can absorb, resolve, or transform tension.
2.2 Closure Integrity
The active closure type (0‑0, ±1→0, ±1→±1) is functioning correctly.
2.3 Flow Continuity
Tension can move without obstruction.
2.4 Polarity Coherence
Polarity does not oscillate or invert uncontrollably.
2.5 Dimensional Alignment
The system’s dimensional load matches its structural capacity.

3. Stability Conditions
A system is stable when:
- tension < capacity
- polarity is stable
- closure transitions complete
- flow pathways are open
- dimensional load is within limits
Stability is dynamic, not static.

4. Instability Conditions
A system becomes unstable when:
- tension > capacity
- polarity oscillates or inverts
- closure transitions fail
- flow pathways are blocked
- dimensional load exceeds limits
Instability is a structural mismatch, not a failure of the subject.

5. Stability States
5.1 Stable State
- tension is processed
- polarity is coherent
- closure transitions complete
- system maintains structure
5.2 Semi‑Stable State
- tension is rising
- polarity is reactive
- closure transitions are slow
- system is vulnerable to overload
5.3 Unstable State
- tension exceeds capacity
- polarity oscillates
- closure fails
- system enters collapse or forced redistribution
5.4 Regenerative State
- tension is transformed
- polarity stabilizes
- closure re‑establishes
- system rebuilds coherence

6. Collapse Modes
Collapse occurs when the system cannot maintain coherence.
6.1 Tension Overload
Capacity is exceeded.
6.2 Polarity Storm
Polarity oscillates faster than closure can stabilize.
6.3 Closure Failure
Transitions stall or loop.
6.4 Dimensional Mismatch
Load exceeds dimensional capacity.
6.5 Flow Blockage
Tension cannot move; system fragments.
Collapse is not final — it triggers forced redistribution.

7. Recovery Modes
Recovery occurs when tension finds a viable pathway.
7.1 Absorptive Recovery (→ 0‑0)
System stabilizes through damping.
7.2 Corrective Recovery (→ ±1→0)
System stabilizes through alignment.
7.3 Generative Recovery (→ ±1→±1)
System stabilizes through transformation.
Recovery is a closure‑driven process.

8. Stability Cycles
Systems move through recurring stability cycles:
8.1 Micro‑Stability
Moment‑to‑moment coherence.
8.2 Meso‑Stability
Phase‑based coherence (projects, groups, relationships).
8.3 Macro‑Stability
Civilizational coherence across historical cycles.
These cycles are defined in detail in the cycles/ directory.

9. Multi‑Agent Stability
In multi‑agent systems:
- tension redistributes
- polarity cascades
- closure transitions propagate
- stability becomes a network property
A system is stable when enough nodes maintain stability, not when all nodes do.

10. Dimensional Stability (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- stability corresponds to dimensional coherence
- higher dimensions provide greater stability capacity
- dimensional folds can stabilize or destabilize systems
- collapse often indicates dimensional mismatch
Stability is the dimensional alignment operator of WLM.

11. Summary
System Stability defines the conditions under which tension, polarity, and closure produce coherent behavior across subjects, groups, and civilizations.
It is the coherence operator of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol and completes the core motion architecture:
- Tension Flow — movement
- Polarity Dynamics — direction
- Closure Transitions — state changes
- System Stability — coherence
