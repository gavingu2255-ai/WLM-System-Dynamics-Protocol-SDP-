WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Interaction Specification

1. Definition
Multi‑Agent Dynamics describes how multiple subjects interact through tension, polarity, closure, and dimensional alignment.
It defines the structural laws governing:
- collective motion
- distributed tension flow
- polarity cascades
- synchronized closure transitions
- system‑level stability or collapse
Multi‑Agent Dynamics is the collective motion operator of WLM.

2. Purpose
This specification provides a formal model for:
- group behavior
- organizational dynamics
- network coherence
- distributed decision‑making
- civilizational evolution
It extends the single‑subject dynamics of SDP into multi‑subject systems.

3. Core Principles
Multi‑agent systems follow five structural principles:
3.1 Distributed Capacity
Total system capacity = sum of individual capacities + network coherence.
3.2 Tension Redistribution
Tension flows across subjects according to capacity gradients.
3.3 Polarity Propagation
Polarity spreads through networks along tension pathways.
3.4 Closure Synchronization
Subjects tend to align closure types under shared tension.
3.5 Dimensional Resonance
Systems stabilize when subjects share dimensional alignment.
These principles govern all collective behavior.

4. Multi‑Agent Loop Activation
Each loop behaves differently in multi‑agent environments:
4.1 Carrier Loop (0‑0)
- absorbs distributed tension
- stabilizes networks
- prevents collapse cascades
4.2 Correction Loop (±1→0)
- resolves shared tension
- aligns group structure
- collapses polarity cascades
4.3 Generation Loop (±1→±1)
- transforms collective tension
- produces new group structure
- increases system‑level dimensional capacity
Multi‑agent systems require all three loops to remain coherent.

5. Interaction Modes
Multi‑agent systems exhibit three primary interaction modes:
5.1 Cooperative Mode
- tension flows freely
- polarity stabilizes
- closure transitions synchronize
- system enters generative expansion
5.2 Competitive Mode
- tension flows unevenly
- polarity intensifies
- closure transitions desynchronize
- system enters oscillation
5.3 Adversarial Mode
- tension becomes destructive
- polarity cascades
- closure fails
- system approaches collapse
These modes are structural, not moral.

6. Multi‑Agent Flow Patterns
6.1 Convergent Flow
Tension moves toward a central high‑capacity subject.
6.2 Divergent Flow
Tension spreads outward from an overloaded subject.
6.3 Cyclic Flow
Tension circulates through a loop of subjects.
6.4 Cluster Flow
Tension redistributes within sub‑groups.
6.5 Cascade Flow
Tension propagates rapidly across the entire network.
Flow pattern determines system‑level stability.

7. Multi‑Agent Stability
A multi‑agent system is stable when:
- tension is distributed proportionally
- polarity cascades are dampened
- closure transitions synchronize
- dimensional alignment is maintained
Stability is a network property, not an individual property.

8. Multi‑Agent Instability
Instability occurs when:
- tension overloads key nodes
- polarity cascades propagate
- closure transitions desynchronize
- dimensional mismatch spreads
Instability leads to:
- fragmentation
- oscillation loops
- collapse cascades
- forced redistribution
These are detailed in system-stability.md.

9. Multi‑Agent Collapse Dynamics
Collapse in multi‑agent systems follows four stages:
9.1 Local Overload
One subject exceeds capacity.
9.2 Propagation
Tension spreads to adjacent nodes.
9.3 Cascade
Polarity storms propagate across the network.
9.4 System Collapse
Network coherence fails.
Collapse is a network event, not an individual failure.

10. Multi‑Agent Recovery Dynamics
Recovery requires:
- re‑establishing capacity gradients
- stabilizing polarity
- synchronizing closure transitions
- restoring dimensional alignment
Recovery is a collective re‑entry into stability.

11. Dimensional Interaction (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- multi‑agent dynamics correspond to dimensional network behavior
- tension moves across layers and nodes
- polarity vectors propagate through dimensional space
- closure transitions ripple across dimensions
Multi‑agent systems are dimensional organisms, not collections of individuals.

12. Summary
Multi‑Agent Dynamics defines how subjects interact through tension, polarity, closure, and dimensional alignment.
It governs:
- collective motion
- distributed tension flow
- polarity cascades
- closure synchronization
- system‑level stability
It is the collective motion operator of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
