WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Interaction Specification

1. Definition
Tension Redistribution describes how tension relocates across subjects, layers, and structures when local capacity is exceeded.
It is the mechanism by which systems:
- prevent local collapse
- balance load
- stabilize polarity
- synchronize closure transitions
- maintain coherence under pressure
Tension Redistribution is the load‑balancing operator of WLM dynamics.

2. Purpose
This specification defines:
- how tension moves between subjects
- how redistribution prevents collapse
- how polarity cascades propagate or dampen
- how closure types influence redistribution
- how dimensional alignment affects flow
Redistribution is essential for system‑level stability.

3. Redistribution Principles
Tension redistribution follows four structural principles:
3.1 Gradient Principle
Tension moves toward subjects with higher capacity.
3.2 Compatibility Principle
Tension flows more easily between subjects with compatible closure types.
3.3 Proximity Principle
Tension prefers the shortest structural pathway (not physical distance).
3.4 Dimensional Resonance Principle
Redistribution is more efficient when subjects share dimensional alignment.
These principles govern all redistribution behavior.

4. Redistribution Triggers
Redistribution activates when:
- a subject exceeds capacity
- polarity destabilizes
- closure transitions fail locally
- dimensional load spikes
- flow pathways become blocked
Redistribution is a protective mechanism, not a failure.

5. Redistribution Modes
5.1 Absorptive Redistribution (0‑0 Dominant)
- tension flows into carrier nodes
- polarity is neutralized
- system stabilizes
5.2 Corrective Redistribution (±1→0 Dominant)
- tension flows into alignment nodes
- polarity collapses
- structure realigns
5.3 Generative Redistribution (±1→±1 Dominant)
- tension flows into generative nodes
- polarity stabilizes
- new structure emerges
Mode depends on the dominant closure type in the network.

6. Redistribution Patterns
6.1 Local Redistribution
Tension moves to adjacent nodes.
6.2 Regional Redistribution
Tension moves across clusters.
6.3 Global Redistribution
Tension propagates across the entire system.
6.4 Cascading Redistribution
Tension triggers sequential overloads across nodes.
6.5 Inversion Redistribution
Tension forces polarity inversion in downstream nodes.
Patterns depend on:
- network topology
- closure distribution
- dimensional alignment

7. Redistribution Load Profiles
7.1 Low Load
- smooth redistribution
- minimal polarity activation
- closure transitions complete
7.2 Medium Load
- uneven redistribution
- polarity begins to cascade
- closure transitions slow
7.3 High Load
- overload propagates
- polarity storms emerge
- collapse becomes likely
High load redistribution is the precursor to system‑level instability.

8. Redistribution Failure Modes
Redistribution fails when:
- no subject has sufficient capacity
- polarity cascades overwhelm the network
- closure transitions desynchronize
- dimensional mismatch spreads
- flow pathways collapse
Failure results in:
- fragmentation
- oscillation loops
- collapse cascades
- forced redistribution
These are detailed in system-stability.md and collapse-and-recovery.md.

9. Interaction With Closure Types
9.1 Carrier Nodes (0‑0)
- absorb redistributed tension
- prevent collapse
- stabilize networks
9.2 Correction Nodes (±1→0)
- resolve redistributed tension
- collapse polarity cascades
- restore coherence
9.3 Generative Nodes (±1→±1)
- transform redistributed tension
- expand structure
- increase system capacity
Healthy redistribution requires all three node types.

10. Multi‑Agent Redistribution
In multi‑agent systems:
- redistribution becomes a network event
- tension flows across capacity gradients
- polarity cascades propagate or dampen
- closure transitions synchronize or fragment
Redistribution determines whether a system:
- stabilizes
- oscillates
- collapses
- regenerates

11. Dimensional Interaction (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- redistribution corresponds to dimensional routing
- tension moves across layers and nodes
- polarity vectors propagate through dimensional space
- closure transitions ripple across dimensions
Tension Redistribution is the dimensional load‑balancing operator of WLM.

12. Summary
Tension Redistribution defines how tension relocates across subjects and structures when local capacity is exceeded.
It governs:
- load balancing
- polarity stabilization
- closure synchronization
- system‑level coherence
It is the load‑balancing operator of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
