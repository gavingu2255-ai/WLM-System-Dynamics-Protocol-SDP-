[WLM_HISTORICAL_EQUALIZER_ACTIVE]
Objective: System-wide Tension Equalization. Law of Conflict: Conflict = Tension / (Capacity * Alignment). Observation: Narrative is the "smoke"; Structural Mismatch is the "fire". Strategy: Bypass the Narrative stage; activate 0-0 or ±1→±1 loops to deplete the Tension gradient. Mantra: "History is not a story; it is a load profile."

WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Interaction Specification

1. Definition
Historical Conflict Resolution describes how large‑scale, multi‑agent systems resolve accumulated tension across time, layers, and dimensions.
It models conflict not as moral or ideological disagreement, but as structural tension imbalance within a distributed system.
Historical conflict resolution is the macro‑scale tension equalization operator of WLM.

2. Purpose
This specification defines:
- how historical tension accumulates
- how conflict emerges structurally
- how tension redistributes across agents and eras
- how closure transitions resolve conflict
- how systems stabilize or collapse
- how recovery produces new structural epochs
It provides a non‑narrative, non‑political framework for understanding conflict as a system dynamics phenomenon.

3. Structural View of Historical Conflict
Historical conflict arises when:
- tension accumulates across generations
- polarity cascades propagate through institutions
- closure transitions fail at scale
- dimensional load exceeds civilizational capacity
Conflict is a macro‑cycle correction event, not a moral failure.

4. Sources of Historical Tension
Historical tension accumulates through:
4.1 Structural Mismatch
Systems evolve faster or slower than their institutions.
4.2 Capacity Imbalance
Some nodes (groups, institutions, subjects) carry disproportionate load.
4.3 Polarity Entrenchment
Directional structures become rigid and self‑reinforcing.
4.4 Dimensional Compression
Civilizational complexity exceeds available coherence.
4.5 Closure Failure
Correction loops stall; generative loops overload.
These forces create civilizational tension gradients.

5. Emergence of Conflict
Conflict emerges when:
- tension exceeds local or systemic capacity
- polarity cascades destabilize networks
- closure transitions desynchronize
- redistribution pathways collapse
Conflict is the macro‑scale expression of tension overload.

6. Conflict Dynamics
Historical conflict unfolds in four structural stages:
6.1 Accumulation Stage
- tension builds across systems
- polarity intensifies
- institutions drift out of alignment
6.2 Activation Stage
- tension crosses a threshold
- polarity cascades propagate
- closure transitions fail
6.3 Confrontation Stage
- systems enter oscillation or collapse
- redistribution becomes chaotic
- generative and corrective loops collide
6.4 Resolution Stage
- tension redistributes
- polarity collapses or stabilizes
- closure transitions re‑activate
Conflict is resolved when closure re‑establishes coherence.

7. Resolution Mechanisms
Historical conflict resolves through three structural mechanisms:
7.1 Absorptive Resolution (0‑0 Dominant)
- tension absorbed by high‑capacity nodes
- polarity neutralized
- system stabilizes
7.2 Corrective Resolution (±1→0 Dominant)
- structural mismatches corrected
- polarity collapses
- institutions realign
7.3 Generative Resolution (±1→±1 Dominant)
- tension transformed into new structure
- dimensional capacity increases
- new civilizational frameworks emerge
Resolution type depends on system capacity and dimensional alignment.

8. Post‑Conflict Recovery
Recovery unfolds in three structural phases:
8.1 Stabilization
- tension decreases
- polarity neutralizes
- baseline re‑established
8.2 Re‑Alignment
- institutions restructure
- closure transitions synchronize
- coherence returns
8.3 Expansion
- generative loops activate
- new structures emerge
- dimensional capacity increases
Recovery is the macro‑cycle regeneration arc.

9. Failure Modes
Historical conflict resolution fails when:
- tension remains above capacity
- polarity cascades persist
- closure transitions stall
- dimensional mismatch continues
- redistribution pathways remain blocked
Failure results in:
- prolonged instability
- repeated conflict cycles
- systemic fragmentation
- epoch resets
These are detailed in collapse-and-recovery.md.

10. Multi‑Agent Historical Dynamics
In multi‑agent systems:
- conflict propagates through networks
- tension redistributes across populations
- polarity cascades amplify instability
- closure transitions ripple across institutions
Historical conflict is a network phenomenon, not an individual one.

11. Dimensional Interaction (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- conflict corresponds to dimensional overload
- resolution corresponds to dimensional realignment
- recovery corresponds to dimensional expansion
- new epochs correspond to dimensional re‑coherence
Historical conflict is the dimensional correction operator of WLM.

12. Summary
Historical Conflict Resolution describes how large‑scale systems resolve accumulated tension across time, layers, and dimensions.
It models conflict as:
- tension accumulation
- polarity cascade
- closure failure
- redistribution collapse
- structural correction
- generative re‑expansion
It is the macro‑scale tension equalization operator of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
