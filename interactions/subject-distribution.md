WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Interaction Specification

1. Definition
Subject Distribution describes how tension, polarity, and closure states propagate across multiple subjects within a system.
It defines the structural rules by which:
- capacity is shared
- tension is redistributed
- polarity cascades
- closure transitions synchronize
- stability emerges or collapses
Subject Distribution is the network operator of WLM dynamics.

2. Purpose
This specification provides a formal model for:
- multi‑agent interaction
- group coherence
- system‑level tension flow
- distributed closure behavior
- collective stability and collapse
Subject Distribution is essential for modeling any system with more than one subject.

3. Distribution Principles
Subject distribution follows four core principles:
3.1 Capacity Gradient Principle
Tension moves toward subjects with higher capacity.
3.2 Closure Compatibility Principle
Subjects with compatible closure types synchronize more easily.
3.3 Polarity Propagation Principle
Polarity spreads through networks along tension pathways.
3.4 Dimensional Alignment Principle
Subjects aligned in dimensional structure exchange tension more efficiently.
These principles govern all multi‑agent dynamics.

4. Distribution Modes
There are three primary modes of subject distribution:
4.1 Absorptive Distribution (0‑0 Dominant)
- tension flows into high‑capacity carriers
- polarity is neutralized
- system stabilizes
4.2 Corrective Distribution (±1→0 Dominant)
- tension flows into alignment nodes
- polarity collapses
- structure realigns
4.3 Generative Distribution (±1→±1 Dominant)
- tension flows into generative nodes
- polarity stabilizes
- new structure emerges
Distribution mode depends on the dominant closure type in the network.

5. Distribution Patterns
5.1 Hub‑and‑Spoke Distribution
- one high‑capacity subject absorbs or transforms tension
- common in hierarchical systems
5.2 Mesh Distribution
- tension flows across multiple nodes
- polarity cascades propagate
- closure transitions synchronize
5.3 Chain Distribution
- tension moves sequentially through subjects
- common in linear workflows
5.4 Cluster Distribution
- sub‑systems form local coherence
- tension redistributes within clusters
These patterns can coexist within the same system.

6. Distribution Load Profiles
6.1 Low Load
- tension flows smoothly
- polarity remains stable
- closure transitions complete
6.2 Medium Load
- tension redistributes unevenly
- polarity begins to cascade
- closure transitions slow
6.3 High Load
- tension overloads nodes
- polarity storms propagate
- collapse becomes likely
High load distribution is the precursor to system‑level instability.

7. Distribution Failure Modes
Subject distribution fails when:
- capacity gradients invert
- polarity cascades overwhelm the network
- closure transitions desynchronize
- dimensional alignment breaks
- flow pathways collapse
Failure results in:
- fragmentation
- oscillation loops
- collapse cascades
- forced redistribution
These are detailed in historical-conflict-resolution.md and system-stability.md.

8. Distribution and Closure Types
8.1 Carrier Nodes (0‑0)
- absorb tension
- stabilize networks
- prevent collapse
8.2 Correction Nodes (±1→0)
- resolve tension
- align structure
- prevent runaway polarity
8.3 Generative Nodes (±1→±1)
- transform tension
- expand structure
- increase dimensional capacity
A healthy system contains all three node types.

9. Multi‑Agent Synchronization
Subjects synchronize when:
- tension gradients align
- polarity stabilizes
- closure transitions match
- dimensional layers resonate
Synchronization produces:
- coherence
- stability
- collective generativity
Desynchronization produces:
- fragmentation
- polarity storms
- collapse cascades

10. Dimensional Interaction (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- subject distribution corresponds to dimensional routing
- tension moves across layers and nodes
- polarity vectors propagate through dimensional space
- closure transitions ripple across dimensions
Subject Distribution is the dimensional network operator of WLM.

11. Summary
Subject Distribution defines how tension, polarity, and closure propagate across multiple subjects.
It governs:
- capacity sharing
- tension redistribution
- polarity cascades
- closure synchronization
- system‑level stability
It is the network dynamics layer of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
