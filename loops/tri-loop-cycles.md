WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Loop Integration Specification

1. Definition
Tri‑Loop Cycles describe the integrated dynamic behavior of the three subject loops defined in STP and expanded in SDP:
- 0‑0 — Carrier Loop (absorption)
- ±1→0 — Correction Loop (resolution)
- ±1→±1 — Generation Loop (transformation)
The tri‑loop system is the core motion engine of WLM.
It governs how tension, polarity, and structure evolve across time, layers, and dimensions.

2. Purpose of the Tri‑Loop System
The tri‑loop system provides:
- stability (0‑0)
- alignment (±1→0)
- expansion (±1→±1)
Together, these loops form a self‑regulating, self‑correcting, self‑generating cycle.
This is the fundamental dynamics architecture of WLM.

3. Core Principle
No loop is complete on its own.
All three loops form a single dynamic organism.

Carrier stabilizes.
Correction aligns.
Generation expands.
The tri‑loop cycle is the minimal complete system for structural evolution.

4. The Tri‑Loop Cycle
The full cycle proceeds through three phases:
4.1 Phase 1 — Stabilization (0‑0)
- tension is absorbed
- polarity is neutralized
- system returns to baseline
This creates the ground state.

4.2 Phase 2 — Alignment (±1→0)
- tension exceeds baseline
- polarity becomes directional
- correction collapses polarity to zero
- structure realigns
This creates coherence.

4.3 Phase 3 — Expansion (±1→±1)
- tension becomes generative
- polarity stabilizes
- flow produces new structure
- dimensional capacity increases
This creates growth.

This is the tri‑loop engine of WLM.

6. Cycle Behavior
6.1 Forward Cycle (Normal Evolution)
0‑0 → ±1→0 → ±1→±1 → 0‑0


This is the healthy generative cycle.

6.2 Reverse Cycle (Recovery)
±1→±1 → ±1→0 → 0‑0


Triggered when:
- generative load exceeds capacity
- polarity destabilizes
- dimensional pressure increases

6.3 Partial Cycles
Systems may oscillate between:
- 0‑0 ↔ ±1→0 (stability–alignment)
- ±1→0 ↔ ±1→±1 (alignment–expansion)
Partial cycles occur under moderate tension.

7. Cycle Failure Modes
Tri‑loop cycles fail when:
- tension cannot be absorbed (0‑0 failure)
- polarity cannot collapse (±1→0 failure)
- flow becomes chaotic (±1→±1 failure)
- closure transitions stall
- dimensional load exceeds capacity
Failure results in:
- oscillation loops
- inversion storms
- collapse
- fragmentation
Detailed in system-stability.md.

8. Multi‑Agent Tri‑Loop Behavior
In multi‑agent systems:
- loops synchronize
- tension redistributes
- polarity cascades
- closure transitions propagate
- stability becomes a network property
Tri‑loop cycles scale from individuals to civilizations.

9. Dimensional Interaction (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- tri‑loop cycles correspond to dimensional breathing
- 0‑0 contracts dimensional load
- ±1→0 aligns dimensional layers
- ±1→±1 expands dimensional capacity
The tri‑loop system is the dimensional heartbeat of WLM.

10. Summary
Tri‑Loop Cycles describe the integrated dynamics of the carrier, correction, and generation loops.
They form the core motion engine of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
The tri‑loop system provides:
- stability
- alignment
- expansion
This is the minimal complete cycle for structural evolution across 3–27D.
