WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Loop Dynamics Specification

1. Definition
The Carrier Loop (0‑0) is the closure type responsible for absorbing tension and stabilizing systems.
Where ±1→0 resolves and ±1→±1 transforms, the carrier loop dampens, buffers, and prevents collapse.
The carrier loop is not passive.
It is a structural stabilizer that maintains coherence across systems and dimensions.

2. Functional Role
The carrier loop performs three essential functions:
- absorb tension without generating polarity
- buffer systems during instability
- provide a stable baseline for correction and generation
It is the stability and damping layer of WLM dynamics.

3. Activation Conditions
The carrier loop activates when:
- tension is low or moderate
- polarity is weak or neutral
- system stability requires buffering
- generative or corrective loops are not viable
In short:
The carrier loop activates when the system needs stability more than change.


4. Carrier Dynamics
4.1 Tension Intake
The loop absorbs tension directly:
Tension → 0


No polarity is generated.
4.2 Polarity Neutralization
Any polarity entering the loop is neutralized:
+1 → 0
−1 → 0


This is the defining operation of the carrier loop.
4.3 Stability Buffering
The system is held in a stable, low‑motion state.
4.4 Baseline Maintenance
The loop maintains a zero‑directional baseline for the entire system.

5. Flow Behavior
5.1 Input
- low‑intensity tension
- unstable polarity
- system noise
- residual load from other loops
5.2 Process
- absorption
- damping
- neutralization
- stabilization
5.3 Output
- stability
- coherence
- readiness for correction or generation
The carrier loop is a self‑stabilizing process.

6. Carrier Load Profiles
6.1 Low Load
- effortless absorption
- minimal structural impact
- stable baseline
6.2 Medium Load
- increased damping
- slower stabilization
- risk of polarity leakage
6.3 High Load
- risk of overload
- polarity breakthrough
- transition to correction (±1→0)
High load carrier loops are precursors to correction cycles.

7. Failure Modes
Carrier loops fail when:
- tension exceeds absorptive capacity
- polarity becomes directional
- dimensional load is too high
- flow pathways are blocked
Failure results in:
- polarity breakthrough
- forced transition to correction
- collapse if unresolved
These are detailed in system-stability.md.

8. Interaction With Other Loops
8.1 With ±1→0 (Correction Loop)
- provides baseline
- receives resolved tension
- forms a stability–alignment cycle
8.2 With ±1→±1 (Generation Loop)
- provides grounding
- receives generative output
- prevents runaway expansion
8.3 With Other 0‑0 Nodes
- forms stabilizing networks
- risk of stagnation if overused

9. Dimensional Behavior (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- carrier loops correspond to dimensional rest states
- tension is absorbed across layers
- polarity collapses to zero
- dimensional load is minimized
Carrier loops are the dimensional grounding operator of WLM.

10. Summary
The Carrier Loop (0‑0) absorbs tension, neutralizes polarity, and stabilizes systems.
It is essential for:
- buffering
- grounding
- coherence
- system recovery
The carrier loop is the stability operator of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
