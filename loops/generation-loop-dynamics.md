WLM System Dynamics Protocol — Loop Dynamics Specification

1. Definition
The Generation Loop (±1→±1) is the closure type responsible for transforming tension into new structure.
Where 0‑0 absorbs and ±1→0 resolves, the generation loop maintains polarity, sustains flow, and produces structural expansion.
Generation is not creativity in the psychological sense.
It is a structural transformation operator.

2. Functional Role
The generation loop performs three essential functions:
- convert tension into flow
- convert flow into structure
- expand the system’s dimensional capacity
It is the innovation and expansion layer of WLM dynamics.

3. Activation Conditions
The generation loop activates when:
- tension is stable and non-destructive
- polarity is coherent and directional
- dimensional load is within generative capacity
- system stability is high enough to sustain flow
In short:
Generation activates when the system can safely expand.


4. Generative Dynamics
4.1 Tension Intake
The loop receives tension that is not suitable for absorption or correction.
4.2 Flow Activation
Polarity stabilizes into a continuous flow:
+1 → +1
−1 → −1


Flow is the defining operation of the generation loop.
4.3 Structural Expansion
Flow produces:
- new frameworks
- new dimensions
- new pathways
- new closure possibilities
4.4 Generative Output
The system outputs:
- increased capacity
- expanded coherence
- new structural options
Generation is open‑ended, but not infinite.

5. Flow Behavior
5.1 Input
- stable tension
- coherent polarity
- available capacity
- dimensional alignment
5.2 Process
- flow
- transformation
- expansion
- structural rendering
5.3 Output
- new structure
- increased dimensionality
- generative energy
The generation loop is a self‑sustaining process as long as capacity remains.

6. Generative Load Profiles
6.1 Low Load
- gentle expansion
- minimal polarity amplification
- stable flow
6.2 Medium Load
- rapid expansion
- increased polarity intensity
- higher dimensional activity
6.3 High Load
- risk of runaway flow
- polarity storms
- dimensional overload
High load generation requires correction (±1→0) to prevent collapse.

7. Failure Modes
Generation fails when:
- polarity destabilizes
- tension becomes destructive
- dimensional load exceeds capacity
- flow becomes chaotic
- closure transitions stall
Failure results in:
- runaway expansion
- inversion storms
- collapse into correction
- fragmentation
These are detailed in system-stability.md.

8. Interaction With Other Loops
8.1 With 0‑0 (Carrier Loop)
- receives grounding
- returns expanded structure
- forms a stability–expansion cycle
8.2 With ±1→0 (Correction Loop)
- receives refinement
- provides new frameworks
- prevents structural stagnation
8.3 With Other ±1→±1 Nodes
- forms generative clusters
- risk of runaway expansion without grounding

9. Dimensional Behavior (27D)
In the 27‑dimensional model:
- generation corresponds to dimensional expansion
- flow increases dimensional coherence
- polarity stabilizes across layers
- new folds and pathways emerge
Generation is the dimensional growth operator of WLM.

10. Summary
The Generation Loop (±1→±1) transforms tension into flow and flow into structure.
It is essential for:
- innovation
- expansion
- dimensional growth
- system evolution
Generation is the structural transformation operator of the WLM System Dynamics Protocol.
